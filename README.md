# Infinite Scroll React

This project demonstrates an infinite scroll implementation in React 17 with functional components. It allows you to display a list of books, provides selection functionality, and offers a convenient "Clear Selection" button.

## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to create a user-friendly and efficient way to showcase a large dataset, such as a list of books, without overwhelming the user with a lengthy initial load. With infinite scrolling, only a portion of the data is initially loaded, and additional items are fetched as the user scrolls down the page. This results in a smoother user experience and improved performance.

## Features

- Display an initial set of 32 books.
- Implement book selection with checkboxes.
- Allow the user to clear their book selection.
- Fetch additional books as the user scrolls to the bottom of the list.
- Dynamic rendering of new books, extending the list infinitely.
